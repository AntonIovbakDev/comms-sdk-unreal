title: On Audio Output Devices Received
---
Triggered when audio output devices are received as a result of calling [Get Audio Output Devices](../Functions/get-audio-output-devices). Each device consists of a name and a native ID. The native ID can be passed to the [Set Audio Output Device](../Functions/set-audio-output-device) function to change the current audio output device.

For example usage, see the [device management tutorial](../../tutorial/device-management).

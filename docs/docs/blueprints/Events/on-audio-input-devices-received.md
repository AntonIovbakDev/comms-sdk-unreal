title: On Audio Input Devices Received
---
Triggered when audio input devices are received as a result of calling [Get Audio Input Devices](../Functions/get-audio-input-devices). Each device consists of a name and a native ID. The native ID can be passed to the [Set Audio Input Device](../Functions/set-audio-input-device) function to change the current audio input device.

For example usage, see the [device management tutorial](../../tutorial/device-management).

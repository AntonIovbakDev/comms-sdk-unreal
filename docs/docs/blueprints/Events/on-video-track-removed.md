title: On Video Track Removed

Triggered when a video track is removed. The event provides information about the video track in its argument. This information consists of the track ID, the ID of the participant from whom the track is coming, and a boolean indicating whether this is a screen share video track or a camera video track.

For example usage, see the [remote video rendering tutorial](../../tutorial/remote-video).

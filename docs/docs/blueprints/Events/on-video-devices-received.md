title: On Video Devices Received

Triggered when video devices are received as a result of calling [Get Video Devices](../Functions/get-video-devices). Each device consists of a name and an ID. The device can be passed to the [Enable Video](../Functions/enable-video) function to start video streaming using that device.

For example usage, see the [camera preview tutorial](../../tutorial/camera-preview).
